# 📘 Welcome to the IS Project Documentation Template!

Hey there! 👋

This repository is your home for documenting your **Innovation School Project** and starting your **maker portfolio**.  
You’ll be using the **GitHub Wiki** to update all your project details in a structured format.

## 🧠 What to Do First

Start by writing a **brief introduction** to your project right here in this `README.md` file:

Our project tries to solve an age old issue. Those hard of hearing cannot experience music in the same way we can. To counter this, we have ccreated a band which converts musical beats and signals to vibrations. This products isn't just for those hard of hearing, but rathel also allows us to experience music in a whole different way.

## 🛠 Where to Document Everything Else

We’ve already created a standard set of [**Wiki pages**](https://github.com/MakersAsylumIndia/Bowl-Buddy/wiki) for your project in this repository — you just need to **update them with your project information**.

Each section is ready with headings like:

- Project Title
- Problem Statement
- Bill of Materials (BOM)
- Solution Overview
- SDG Goals Associated
- Circuit & CAD Files
- Media Gallery
- License

Please **do not delete the headings** — just replace the placeholder content under each.
